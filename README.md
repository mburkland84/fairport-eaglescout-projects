# fairport-eaglescout-projects
A JSON (and a website later to come perhaps?) of Eagle Scout Projects across Fairport, NY. 

Most data was gathered by word of mouth thorugh Evan Burnett. Original data points and pictures were collected on August 7th and 8th 2021 by Marissa Burkland and Evan Burnett.

This is just a personal project to see my hometown before moving away but future data additions are welcome.
