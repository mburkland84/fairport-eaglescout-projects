# fairport-eaglescout-projects
A GeoJSON (and a website later to come perhaps?) of Eagle Scout Projects across Fairport, NY. 

Most data was gathered by word of mouth through Evan Burnett. Original data points and pictures were collected on August 7th and 8th 2021 by Marissa Burkland and Evan Burnett.

This is just a personal project to tour my hometown before moving away but future data additions and usage of data for other projects are welcome.

Let me know if you use the data though and send me a link to the project.
